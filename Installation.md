# Installation

- Click on "Releases" on the right side of the main window.
- Download ShoppingListSetup.exe.
- Run the setup executable.
- You will need to make Windows install it. If that makes you nervous, don't install it.

That should do it.  I pinned the icon to my desktop taskbar so I can always find it quickly.
